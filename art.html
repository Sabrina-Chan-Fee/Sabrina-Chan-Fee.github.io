      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Here are some personal artistic projects I did during my free time. I’ve always wanted to learn how to watercolor. Thus, I taught myself, with the help of online tutorials. In addition, other projects include hand drawn pieces. Since environmental design, architecture, and baking are one of my main inspirations and something I enjoy learning about, their influence can be seen throughout my different artworks.

          <h1>Café Menu</h1>
          <p>
            Since I love baking small pastries, I wanted to have fun creating cute small aesthetic desserts. At the end, I chose to paint drinks with fun creative flavors because the way watercolor naturally bleeds on paper gives a similar effect to pouring colored syrups in fun drinks!

          <p>I love to travel and was fortunate enough to visit Venice. I enjoyed exploring the small alleyways, coffee shops, and small stores. As I always make it a tradition to draw or paint something when traveling, I decided to use Venice as my main inspiration, during this trip.</p>

          <h1>Summer Drink Daylight version</h1>
          <p>
        The daylight version of this drawing has a more cheerful and bubbly look and included a lot of pink and floral elements.
            <br> <br>Inspiration: I wanted to create 2 versions of a drawing, one inspired by daylight and one inspired by nighttime, while having both drawing take inspiration from my memories of summer.

          <h1>Summer Drink Nighttime version</h1>
          <p>The nighttime version of this drawing includes a cold color palette such as green, blue and purple and looks more calm and serene.
            <br> <br>Inspiration: Summer is my favorite season and drinking green tea outside at night with friends is something I always look forward to when the weather warms up!

          <h1>Tramway Coffee Shop</h1>
          <p>
          This painting is a tramway repurposed as a small cozy bookshop and café. The main idea behind this piece stems from my love for architecture, the idea of renovating old buildings, and the aesthetic of old tramways.

          <h1>Birthday Card#1</h1>
          <p>
            I enjoy making homemade birthday cards for my friends since it gives me the chance to customize them for each person. In this case, my friend's favorite color is orange, so I decided to have large orange flowers as well as blue and purple ones in the background to create contrast. In addition, the contrasting cold colors work well with the snow globe in the background since my friend’s favorite season is winter.

          <h1>Birthday Card#2</h1>
          <p>This is another birthday card dedicated to another good friend of mine. I chose youthful pastel colors, roses, and ribbons to capture her bright spirit and personality because she is a very joyful and bubbly person.</p>
