      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Here are some personal artistic projects I did during my free time. I’ve always wanted to learn how to watercolor, thus I self-taught myself how. In addition, other project include hand drawn pieces. Since environmental design, architecture
        and baking are one of my main inspiration and something I enjoy learning, their influence can be seen though out my different art works.

          <p>
            Since I love baking small pastries, I wanted to have fun creating cute small aesthetic dessert. Since, I wanted to use my watercolor, I choose to paint drinks with fun creative flavor instead to match the way in which watercolor natural bleeds on paper.

          <p>I love to travel and was fortunate to visit Venice. I enjoyed exploring the small alley ways, coffee shops and small stores. And since I always make it a tradition to draw or paint something when travelling, I decided to use Venice as my
            main inspiration during this trip.</p>

            The day version of this drawing has a more cheerful and bubbly look and included a lot of pink and floral elements.
            <br> <br>Inspiration: I wanted to create 2 version of a drawing, one day and one night but both inspired by my memories of summer.

            This painting is a tramway repurposed as a small cozy book shop and café. The main idea behind this piece steam from my love for architecture, the idea of renovating old building and the aesthetic of old tramway.

          <h1>Birthday Card#1</h1>
          <p>
            I enjoy making homemade birthday cards for my friends since it gives me the chance to customizes them for each person. In this case, my friend's favorite color is orange, thus I decides to have large orange flowers as well as blue and
            purple ones in the background to create contrast. In addition, the constating cold color work well with the snow globe in the background since my friend’s favorite season is winter.

          <h1>Birthday Card#2</h1>
          <p>This is another birthday card dedicated to another good friend of mines. Since she is a very bright and bubbly person, I choose youthful pastel colors, roses and ribbons to caputure her spirit and personality.</p>
