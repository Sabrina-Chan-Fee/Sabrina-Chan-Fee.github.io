      <p>Coming from a background in pure science from CEGEP, mathematics and technology have always interested me. Furthermore, I have always been a creative person with a vast interest in different artistic fields. While searching for the answer to the big question: “What do I want to do in life?” I discovered the world of user experience. As someone who loves learning about functional design and enjoys finding and understanding patterns in human behavior, the field of UX/UI checks all the boxes for me. I hope to pursue a career in that field after graduation. </p>
      <p>
      I have always been interested in architecture, product design and environmental design, so naturally, 3D modeling became an interest of mine too. In spring 2022, I signed up for an AutoCAD class (CECD 219) with the university and it gave me the confidence and necessary tools to 3D model in AutoCAD. In summer 2022, I decided to take the initiative and learn Blender on my own. Ever since then, my interest in 3D modeling has grown. I often work on projects for hours without noticing how much time has passed. The process is always fun and enriching. Each time, I grow more as a 3D modeler, and I hope to expand my knowledge of the tool even further.
      </p>
      <p>
In fall 2022, I signed up for an HTML and CSS class (CEWP 239) to learn more about different coding languages. at the end of my classes, I have gained a strong understanding of the basics in HTML and CSS, which I hope to improve as I practice making more creative personal projects, during my free time.
