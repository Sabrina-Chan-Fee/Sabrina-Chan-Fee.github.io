    <article class="about-me1">
      <p>Having graduated cegep in Pure and Apply and having different artistic hobbies throughout my life, such as drawing and painting. I’ve always been interested in fields related to science, maths and I love exploring different art fields. I
        love exploring different art fields, traveling and I’m always motivated to learn new things.
        Recently, during the summer of 2022, I’ve learned the basic ropes of 3D modeling. I've have grown to really enjoy it and would like to expand my knowledge even further.". In additional having taken COMP 218, in the fall semester and my
        interest in computer science has only grown more and I plan to learn more about different languages such as Java and Python.
        While searching for the answer to the big question of “What I would like to do in life?”, I learned about User experience. As someone who loves learning about functional design, enjoys finding and understanding pattern in human behavior, the
        world of UX/UI has checked all the boxes for me. I hope to pursue a career path in that field.
