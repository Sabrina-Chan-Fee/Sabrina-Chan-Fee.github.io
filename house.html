      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>My goal for this project was to create a model of a house inspired by modern Japanese architecture as a chance to learn Blender over the weekend. In addition, I also took the chance to use this as my main inspiration for my final project in CECD 219. After finding some inspiration, I started with drawing out a rough sketch on paper then created a 2D AutoCAD drawing. While working with AutoCAD, I used AutoCAD block for the plants and stone texture. With the help of online video tutorials, I tried to recreate the house on Blender. One of the challenges was to learn how to render the model. Another challenge was finding a way to emulate the brick pattern from the 2D drawing. At the end I was able to achieve a good grade for the 2D AutoCAD drawing and was able to successfully recreate the house in blender in under 24 hours and was able to render it in the span of 2 days.

    <article class="text1 slide-up show-on-scroll">
      <p>When looking for inspiration for this project the first thing I did was look for reference pictures and examples of modern Japanese Architecture. After having compiled different reference photos and inspiration, I've picked out details and aspect from modern Japanese architecture that I wanted to implement into my project. One of those elements was the common use of materials just as wood, black plaster, cedar, granite, and paper (architectural digest). Thus, I decide to add wooden details along the window and walls as well as stones accent walls.

      <p>Other aspect that I wanted to integrate into my design was “the integration of interior and exterior spaces which is often found in sukiya residential architecture” and Engawa which “is like an outdoor corridor which is a raised wooden or bamboo veranda that runs around the outside edge of the building. This can be found in Japanese traditional houses as well as temples and shrines and this is where people sit and look out into the garden. “ (Japan Wonder Travel Blog) Thus I added a courtyard that is framed by and outdoor corridor.</p>
