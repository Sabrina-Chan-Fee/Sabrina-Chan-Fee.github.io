      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>After getting a better understanding of 3D modeling in AutoCAD from my <a href="plaza.html">previous projects</a>, I decided that for this personal project, I would create something a little more complex to put my skills to the test. During this process, I was able to get a better grip on what I was doing with less help from online tutorials. In the end, I was able to complete the project with more ease than my previous work and better hone my 3D modeling skill in AutoCAD. </p>

    <article class="text1 slide-up show-on-scroll">
      <p>I took inspiration from chemistry and chose to use the shape of an H2O water molecule, as my main inspiration, which can be seen by the shape of the roof. I also took inspiration from Mid-Century Modernism architecture by adding large glass walls and windows to create a fluidity between the outdoor space. Steel frames, the use of clean lines, and shifting planes are also elements found in Mid-Century Modernism that I tried to incorporate in this building. Despite this project having a lot of different layers and components, I was happy to see the vision in my head successfully come to life.
